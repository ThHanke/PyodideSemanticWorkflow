# Pyodide Semantic Workflow

This repository contains An example of a semanticaly expressed python workflow for use in react flow UI integrations using Pyodide (Python compiled to WebAssembly). The goal is to demonstrate how Python code can run in the browser via Pyodide to process data, run lightweight machine-learning or semantic search tasks, and to prototype interactive data-processing or model-driven user interfaces without a backend server.

Key ideas

- Run Python entirely in the browser using Pyodide so you can prototype workflows that combine Python tooling and web UI.
- Integrate semantic components (embeddings, similarity search, text processing) with local/browser-run Python for interactive demos and experimentation.
- Provide small, self-contained examples and scripts that show how to load Pyodide, execute Python, and move data between JS and Python.
